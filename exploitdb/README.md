# ExploitDB importer

This module reads data from [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)'s official repository.  Exploit data is loaded into the `Exploit` model.

> ExploitDB frequently links Exploits with CVEs, but has also links to other databases like the (no longer active) [Open Source Vulnerability DB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Source_Vulnerability_Database) and Microsoft Security Bulletins (e.g., [MS13-053](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/blob/master/MS13-053/README.md)).

## Notes

* All exploits seem to have a `date_added` field, but some exploits do not have a `date_updated`.

* Many exploits are indeed updated after they are added to the database:

   ```bash
   $ xsv select id,date_added,date_updated files_exploits.csv \
      | awk -F, '{if($2!=$3){print $0;}}' | wc -l
   32225
   ```
