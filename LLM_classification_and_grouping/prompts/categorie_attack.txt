1. Category: Simulated Attack. Description: The script runs tests that simulate real attacks or perform attack-like behaviors, confirming the existence of the vulnerability, performing active probes, including parameters on the URL or making specific and detailed requests to collect information about the target machine.

1.1. Subcategory: External Code Execution. Description: Attempts to execute code or a payload on the target machine from an external connection. If the code attempts to perform malicious actions, inject code on the target, gain access over the target, performs buffer overflow or just tests whether it is possible to execute remote code, then it falls into this category.
1.2. Subcategory: Unauthorized Login. Description: Tries to access a running service by guessing potential credentials (like brute force) or hijacking an authenticated user session.
1.3. Subcategory: Protected Information. Description: Attempts to access restricted files, reveal sensitive information, change system settings or machine parameters or gain privileged access that should be protected and inaccessible to unauthorized users.
1.4. Subcategory: Denial of Service (DoS). Description: Attempts to disrupt or overload a service, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
1.5. Subcategory: Privileged Attack. Description: Attempts to exploit vulnerabilities with memory manipulation, payloads or remote code execution through credentials provided by the user in the tool parameters. If the code has as parameters, access credentials necessary for its operation then it falls into this category.
