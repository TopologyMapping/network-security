=====

Ranking name: ExcellentRanking	

Ranking description: The exploit will never crash the service. This is the case for SQL Injection, CMD execution, RFI, LFI, etc. No typical memory corruption exploits should be given this ranking unless there are extraordinary circumstances (WMF Escape()).

=====

Ranking name: GreatRanking	

Ranking description: The exploit has a default target AND either auto-detects the appropriate target or uses an application-specific return address AFTER a version check.
GoodRanking	The exploit has a default target and it is the “common case” for this type of software (English, Windows 7 for a desktop app, 2012 for server, etc). Exploit does not auto-detect the target.

=====

Ranking name: NormalRanking	

Ranking description: The exploit is otherwise reliable, but depends on a specific version that is not the “common case” for this type of software and can’t (or doesn’t) reliably autodetect.
AverageRanking	The exploit is generally unreliable or difficult to exploit, but has a success rate of 50% or more for common platforms.

=====

Ranking name: LowRanking	

Ranking description: The exploit is nearly impossible to exploit (under 50% success rate) for common platforms.

=====

Ranking name: ManualRanking	

Ranking description: The exploit is unstable or difficult to exploit and is basically a DoS (15% success rate or lower). This ranking is also used when the module has no use unless specifically configured by the user (e.g.: exploit/unix/webapp/php_eval).
