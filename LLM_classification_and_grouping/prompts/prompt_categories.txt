To complete this task, analyze the detection script code, metadata, comments and verifications to find how the detection is made. First identify the category of a script, and then the subcategory. Please, to answer the question, fill out the template below. Change only the sections within curly braces, keep the braces on the response, and follow the intructions within the braces considering the explanation above:

How the script works?
Category: {Category}
Subcategory: {Subcategory}
Explanations: {explanation about the code}

If a subcategory matches the script, please simply report the name of the subcategory and do not provide any additional explanation. If no match is found, please propose and describe a new category or subcategory.

For example, if the category is "1. Category: Simulated Attack", change the curly braces {Category} to {Simulated Attack} and not {1. Simulated Attack}.
Another example: if the subcategory is "1.3. Subcategory: Protected Information", change the curly braces to {Protected Information} and not {1.3. Protected Information}.

Think carefully.
