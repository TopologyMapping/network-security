3. Category: Basic Active Requests. Description: The script gathers information by making simple requests or observing data that the target system passively exposes such as responde banners with software version, configuration details, URLs or open services. The test does not require authentication, perform any intrusive actions, authentication attempts, attack simulations, nor crafts specific packets for requests.

3.1. Subcategory: Banner Check. Description: Checks software information, application version, HTTP status code or the running service based on the initial response (banner) sent by the server after basic interaction from the scanner. Returns inferred vulnerabilities or the information collected just sendind simple requests and checking elements of the response. If a code performs a request and just check the response once, then enters in this subcategory.
3.2. Subcategory: URL Presence Check. Description: Identifies the vulnerabilities checking if exists vulnerable URLs or paths on the target. The tested URL is present in the code and represents the vulnerability. The URL is not provided by the user as a parameter for executing the script. If the vulnerability is detected by the presence of the URL, then the code falls into this category.
3.3. Subcategory: Discovery. Description: Executes other actions to test the existence of the vulnerability without actually exploiting it, or performs active probing to just collect information about the target machine.
