1.3 Properties of a System: Scripts may identify properties of a system.

For scripts that identify properties of a system, please find: (A) a one-phrase description of the property being identified; (B) the value of the identified property, if applicable.

To complete this task, analyze the detection script code, metadata, comments and verifications to find what is detected, the application, specific targets, and other necessary information. If you cannot find one of the required information, just answer with "Uncertain".

What is detected: {select one of Vulnerability, Unmaintained Software, or Property of a System, as described above and answer directly}
