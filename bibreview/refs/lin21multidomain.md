# Summary

* analysis performed with ground truth from the Software Assurance Reference Database (SARD), which contains synthetic vulnerability and test cases
* identification of vulnerabilities using multiple databases, idea is to automatically extract features using deep learning techniques and check which ones are useful in identifying vulnerabilities in SARD
* one key challenge is that some works assume that large training datasets are available, which is rarely the case for vulnerabilities: tagging requires manual effort
